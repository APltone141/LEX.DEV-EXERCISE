### 2. FAQ Section

**Q: How many test cases should I write?**
A: Focus on quality over quantity. Cover all main scenarios, edge cases, and error conditions. 10-15 well-written test cases are better than 50 poorly written ones.

**Q: What's the difference between Priority and Severity?**
A: Severity is the impact on the system, Priority is the urgency to fix. A cosmetic bug might have low severity but high priority if it's on the homepage.

**Q: How do I know if a bug is worth reporting?**
A: If it deviates from expected behavior, affects user experience, or could cause issues, report it. When in doubt, report it.

**Q: Should I test on all browsers?**
A: For basic level, focus on Chrome and one other browser. Test on mobile view as well. Advanced testing covers more browsers.

**Q: How detailed should test steps be?**
A: Detailed enough that someone else can execute them without asking questions. Include specific data and expected results.
